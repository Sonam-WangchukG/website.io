									<p>My name is Sonam Wangchuk Ghaley, and I am a student at the Royal Academy.
										 I live in Thimphu, but I am originally from Sarpang, and both places have played an important role in shaping who I am. I enjoy learning new things, exploring the outdoors, and spending time with the people I care about. Sports are a big part of my life, and whenever 
										 I have free time, I love playing football, badminton, volleyball, or even a quiet game of chess. I value kindness, curiosity, and 
										 the desire to grow as a person. I enjoy trying new experiences, whether it’s going on hikes with my family, listening to music when I’m bored, or pushing myself in my studies as I plan to pursue Science in the future. The seven gifts help me understand myself better, appreciate my strengths, and reflect on the person I want to become as I continue to learn and grow.</p>

									<h1> Astro Lab 108</h1>
									<p>I chose the astro lab because I was curious about the universe and wanted to use my data science skills (Python, NumPy, Matplotlib) on real celestial data. My goal was to learn the methodologies astronomers use, blending programming with observational science.

                                        The course successfully diversified my knowledge by combining computer science and astrophysics. I improved my Python skills for data processing and gained practical expertise in key methods like transit detection (for planet size) and the radial velocity method (for planet mass), using data from satellites like TESS. 
                                        This taught me Astroinformatics, making complex research feel achievable.</p>
